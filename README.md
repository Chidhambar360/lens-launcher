Instead of scrolling long lists or swiping through multiple pages, Lens Launcher implements two unique features:

<b>• An Equispaced Grid that displays all of your apps, regardless of screen size or app count.</b>

<b>• A Graphical Fisheye Lens to quickly zoom, pan and launch apps using touch gestures.</b>

The Graphical Fisheye Lens algorithm is derived from methods proposed by Manojit Sarkar and Marc H. Brown. Their original 1993 paper, titled <i>Graphical Fisheye Views</i>, can be found here:

Lens Launcher also includes a full Settings menu to tweak all aspects of the Lens; Distortion, Scaling, Icon Size, Haptic Feedback, etc.
